Developed as the final project for the T5 SDAIA BootCamp, the ChatBot operates in Arabic and is powered by Large Language Models (LLM) and LangChain technology.

## Introduction:
Our project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance legal case accessibility in Saudi Arabia.

## Project Goals:
- Recognize and remove persons and organizations' names by fine-tuning the NER model.
- Find similar cases and summarize them.
- Build a Chatbot using LangChain and LLM.

## Website Structure:
three-tab structure of our user-centric website:
- "Ask Your Question" tab for chatbot interaction.
- "Similar Cases" tab for efficient case discovery.
- "Removing Names" tab as a transparent guide for name removal.
